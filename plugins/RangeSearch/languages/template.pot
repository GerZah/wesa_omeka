"To specify a triple unit, please use the form “a-b-c”, e.g. like this:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"yd-ft-in\n"
"m-cm-mm\n"
"</pre>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"You may also specify hierarchical conversion rates between the three single "
"units;\n"
"you can do so by adding them in round bracktets after the triple unit, e.g. "
"like this:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"yd-ft-in (1-3-12)\n"
"m-cm-mm (1-100-10)\n"
"</pre>\n"
"By this you would have specified that (a) 1 yard equals 3 feet,\n"
"while 1 foot equals 12 inch and (b) that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters,\n"
"while 1 centimeter equals 10 millimeters. — Obviously, the first number "
"inside\n"
"the round brackets will always be “1”.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Additionally, you may group multiple triple units into categories; you can "
"do so\n"
"by adding the category name in box brackets before the triple unit, e.g. "
"like this:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"[Imperial] mi-yd-ft\n"
"[Imperial] yd-ft-in (1-3-12)\n"
"[Metric] km-m-cm\n"
"[Metric] m-cm-mm (1-100-10)\n"
"</pre>\n"
"As you can see, you may specify a category name even if you have not "
"specified\n"
"conversion factors.<br>\n"
"<em>Please note:</em> While “yard” and “meter” are each specified twice in "
"two\n"
"different triple units, Range Search has now way to connect them "
"semantically.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Entering numbers or ranges (hence the name, Range Search) into metadata "
"fields,\n"
"you may use the pop-up tool that you can reach from within the item editor. "
"You\n"
"may also type them manually in the form given below, i.e. using the "
"concrete\n"
"numbers together with the unit names, e.g. like this:\n"
"<pre>\n"
"1yd-2ft-3in\n"
"1m-50cm - 2m\n"
"</pre>\n"
"As you can see, you may omit the last one or two numbers and units.<br>\n"
"<em>Please note:</em> The first number (i.e. the highest significant unit) "
"may\n"
"be up to ten digits long, while the second and third number (i.e. the two "
"lower\n"
"significant units) may each be up to four digits long.\n"
"</p>\n"
